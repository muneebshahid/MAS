Why is matrix composition needed?
Matrix decomposition reduces the dimensions of the matrix, thus decreasing computations.
How does LU decomposition work?
It decomposes matrix in two matrices U orthogonal and L lower triangular.
What is significance of SVD?
SVD decomposes singular and non square matrices.
